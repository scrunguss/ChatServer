Allow your user(s) to play Dungeons of Doom!  Adapt your DoD implementation so that it can connect to
 the server as a DoDClient.  i.e.  The IP address and port are provided as command linearguments, then
  connects to the specified server.  The DoDClient should then allow other users tojoin and control a
   player in the Dungeon of Doom.For example:> [Alan] JOIN>
  [DoDClient] Player Alan has been spawned.
   > [Ben] JOIN> [DoDClient] Player Ben has been spawned.
   > [Alan] MOVE W> [DoDClient] Player Alan: SUCCESS.
   > [Alan] EXIT> [DoDClient] Player Alan has exited.
You will get additional marks for the DoDClient only sending responses to individual players.
E.g. if player Alan calls LOOK, only Alan should see the map in response.
