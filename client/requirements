4.  The server broadcasts all messages received to all connected clients.
6.  The server shuts down cleanly if its user enter EXIT on the terminal.

3.  The client must be able to receive messages sent from the server.
4.  The client should output all messages received by the server.

Allow user(s) to talk to a chat bot - note we do not expect you to implement AI and NLP algorithms,
rather you can achieve full marks with a chat bot that provides simple (e.g. pre-scripted) responses
to user interactions with the chat bot. See for example https://rubberduckdebugging.com/.The chat bot
 must be run as a client (i.e. run with an IP address and port provided as commandline arguments,
  then connect to the specified server).

Allow your user(s) to play Dungeons of Doom!  Adapt your DoD implementation so that it can connect to
 the server as a DoDClient.  i.e.  The IP address and port are provided as command linearguments, then
  connects to the specified server.  The DoDClient should then allow other users tojoin and control a
   player in the Dungeon of Doom.For example:> [Alan] JOIN> [DoDClient] Player Alan has been spawned.
   > [Ben] JOIN> [DoDClient] Player Ben has been spawned.
   > [Alan] MOVE W> [DoDClient] Player Alan: SUCCESS.
   > [Alan] EXIT> [DoDClient] Player Alan has exited.
You will get additional marks for the DoDClient only sending responses to individual players.
E.g. if player Alan calls LOOK, only Alan should see the map in response.
